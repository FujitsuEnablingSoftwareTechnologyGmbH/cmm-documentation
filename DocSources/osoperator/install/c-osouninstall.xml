        <section>
            <p>As an OpenStack operator you are responsible for uninstalling <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> agents, if required. The OpenStack extensions you have installed for your platform are uninstalled by the Monitoring Service operator.</p>
            <p>Before uninstalling an agent, it is recommended that you make a backup of the configuration files created for operation. For details on backups, refer to <xref
                    href="c-osobackup.xml"/>.</p>
            <p>To uninstall a Metrics Agent or a Log Agent, proceed as follows:</p>
            <ol
                            compact="no">
                <li>
                    <p>Log in to the Control Machine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the configuration file of the Control Machine with your favorite editor. </p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check that the hosts from which to uninstall an agent are configured correctly. Note that multiple instances of an agent are uninstalled if multiple hosts are specified in the file.</p>
                    <p>The IP address of the remote machines as well as the user name of the user who is to uninstall the agent must be specified. </p>
                    <note othertype="note">The user who uninstalls the agent must have access to the corresponding hosts. Access as a user with root privileges is required. </note>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To run the uninstaller for one or multiple instances of a Metrics Agent, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>ansible-playbook /opt/FJSVsvcmm/monasca-agent-uninstaller.yml</codeblock>
                    <p>To run the uninstaller for one or multiple instances of a Log Agent, execute the following command:</p>

                        />, execute the following commands:</p>
                    <codeblock>userdel -r mon-agent
userdel -r mon-log-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The agents and their dependencies are uninstalled: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The agents are stopped.</li>
                <li>The corresponding services are removed (<codeph>openstack-monasca-agent</codeph> or <codeph>openstack-monasca-log-agent</codeph>).</li>
                <li>The agents' configuration files and the directories where they are located are removed.</li>
