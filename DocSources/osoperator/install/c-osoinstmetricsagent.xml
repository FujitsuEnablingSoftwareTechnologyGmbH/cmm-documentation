    <title>Installing the Metrics Agent</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>For monitoring your OpenStack services, a Metrics Agent must be installed on each OpenStack node where services you want to monitor are provided. </p>
            <p>As a prerequisite for installing an agent, the offline resources, the OpenStack extensions, and the Monitoring Service must have been installed.</p>
            <p>The installation consists of the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Installing the agent.</li>
                <li>Configuring the agent.</li>
            </ol>
            <note othertype="note">
                <p>If you want to use ApacheWeb Server, MySQL, Postfix, or RabbitMQ checks, there are additional preparations you need to take <b>before</b> installing the agent. For details on the preparations, refer to <xref
                        href="../../shared/appendix/r-metricsadditional.xml"/>.</p>
            </note>
            <p>As an OpenStack operator, you are also responsible for preparing the monitoring environment for your application operators who have booked a virtual machine in OpenStack. They monitor their virtual machines on the compute nodes with libvirt. For details, refer to <xref
                    href="../prepare/c-osopreparetu.xml"/>.</p>
