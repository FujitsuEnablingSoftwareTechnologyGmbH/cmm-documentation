    <title>Disabling Log Data for a Log Agent on the OpenStack Platform</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>To disable the collection of specific log data that is no longer needed in the configuration of a Log Agent, you have to delete the corresponding entries in the <codeph>agent.conf</codeph> configuration file. </p>
            <note othertype="note">
                <p>The following step-by-step description refers to a Log Agent that you have installed on an OpenStack node. It is assumed that there is no need to disable log data for the Log Agent used for monitoring <ph
                        conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> itself.</p>
            </note>
            <p>Proceed as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Log in to the node where the agent is installed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To stop the agent, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo systemctl stop monasca-log-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the agent configuration file with your favorite editor.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo vim opt/monasca/monasca-log-agent/conf/agent.conf</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the <codeph>input</codeph> section, delete the file block for the log data you no longer want to monitor.</p>
                    <p>If you do not want to monitor log data on Keystone any longer, for example, delete the following file block:</p>
                    <codeblock>file {
    path =&gt; "/var/log/keystone/*.log"
  }</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To start the agent again, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo systemctl start monasca-log-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
            </ol>
