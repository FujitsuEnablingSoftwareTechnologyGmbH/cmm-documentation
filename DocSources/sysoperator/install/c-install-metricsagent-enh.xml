    <title>Activating Additional Metrics</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>The agent installation automatically configures and activates a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring your services and servers. The agent ships with additional metrics templates that you can manually adapt to your environment and activate for monitoring, if required.</p>
            <p>For a list of the metrics that are supported by <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>, refer to <xref
                    href="../appendix/r-metricsintro.xml"
                    />. For information on the complete set of metrics that is provided by the Monasca project, refer to the <xref
                    format="html" href="https://github.com/openstack/monasca-agent/blob/stable/pike/docs/Plugins.md"
                    scope="external"
                ><u><i>Monasca documentation</i></u></xref>. If you want to extend your monitoring environment to perform additional checks, contact your FUJITSU support organization.</p>
            <p>To activate additional metrics,  proceed as follows: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Log in to the OpenStack node on which the agent is installed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To stop the agent, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo systemctl stop monasca-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Copy the required template file.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo cp -p \
 /opt/monasca-agent/share/monasca/agent/conf.d/rabbitmq.yaml.example \
 /etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/rabbitmq.yaml</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the template file with your favorite editor.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo vim /etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/rabbitmq.yaml</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Adapt the configuration to your environment. For configuration examples, refer to <xref
                            href="../appendix/r-metricsadditional.xml"/>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To start the agent again, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo systemctl start monasca-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The activated metrics can instantly be used by the agent for retrieving monitoring data.</p>
