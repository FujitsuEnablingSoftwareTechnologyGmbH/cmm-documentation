            <p>The installation of <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> comprises the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Preparing the installation environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Preparing the integration of <ph

                        /> with your OpenStack platform.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Installing the <b>Monitoring Service</b>. It is recommended that you use a dedicated physical machine for the Monitoring Service which meets the requirements outlined in the next section. It is not recommended that there are any other services running on the machine.</p>
                    <note othertype="note">
                        <p>For <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                                /> in productive operation, do not install the Monitoring Service on a virtual machine. <ph

                <li>
                    <p>Installing a <b>Metrics Agent</b>. A Metrics Agent is installed as an extension to your OpenStack platform for monitoring an OpenStack service and the server on which it is deployed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Installing a <b>Log Agent</b>. A Log Agent is installed as an extension to your OpenStack platform for managing the logs of an OpenStack service and the server on which it is deployed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Installing the <b>Horizon Plugin</b>. The Horizon Plugin is installed as an extension to your OpenStack plaform . It is required for  accessing the monitoring functions from the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. </p>

            <p>The following picture depicts where the components are installed. It shows a simplified scenario with a <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> node and one OpenStack node. </p>

            <p>A productive OpenStack environment consists of multiple nodes on which multiple services are deployed. Observe the following when installing <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Horizon Plugin is installed on the node where the OpenStack Horizon Service is deployed.</li>
                <li>A Metrics Agent and a Log Agent are installed on the node where the service you want to monitor is deployed.</li>
            </ul>
