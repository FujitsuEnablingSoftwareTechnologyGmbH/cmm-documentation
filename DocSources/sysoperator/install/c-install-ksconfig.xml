            <p>You need to take the following preparations:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Set the OpenStack administator credentials.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create a project, a user, and roles .</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Define services and endpoints.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
