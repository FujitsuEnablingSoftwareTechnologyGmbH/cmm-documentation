            <p>monasca-docker includes an internal keystone instance, redirection to an external keystone is required.</p>
            <p>The configuration must take into account a single OS Keystone instance as well as a load balancer that distributes the load to multiple OS Keystone instances in OS HA.</p>

            <p>All authentication and authorization in <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> is done through OpenStack Keystone. The integration of <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> with OpenStack must therefore be prepared <b>before</b> you can proceed with installing the Monitoring Service on the <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> node as well as a Metrics Agent, a Log Agent, and the Horizon Plugin in your OpenStack environment.</p>
            <p>You need to take the following preparations:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Set the OpenStack administator credentials.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create a project, a user, and the required roles.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Define services and endpoints.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
