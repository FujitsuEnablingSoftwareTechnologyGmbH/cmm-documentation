            <p>To integrate <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> with the OpenStack Keystone service, you created a project, a user, and two roles in OpenStack. </p>
            <p>To remove them from your OpenStack environment, proceed as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Remove the OpenStack project that was used for the monitoring data retrieved for <ph
                            conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> and your OpenStack services and servers.</p>
                    <p>Example with <codeph>monasca</codeph> as project name:</p>
                    <codeblock>openstack project delete monasca</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Remove the OpenStack user that was used for authenticating an agent against OpenStack Keystone. </p>
                    <p>Example with <codeph>monasca-agent</codeph> as user name:</p>
                    <codeblock>openstack user delete monasca-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Remove the OpenStack roles that were prepared.</p>
                    <p>Example with <codeph>monasca-user</codeph> and <codeph>monasca-agent</codeph> as role names:</p>
                    <codeblock>openstack role delete monasca-user
openstack role delete monasca-agent</codeblock>
                </li>
            </ol>
