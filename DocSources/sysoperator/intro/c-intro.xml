            <p>The component architecture of OpenStack provides for high flexibility, yet it increases the burden of system operation because multiple services must be handled. <ph

                    /> offers an integrated view of all services and assembles and presents related metrics and log data in one convenient access point. While being flexible and scalable to instantly reflect changes in the OpenStack platform, <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> provides the ways and means required to ensure multi-tenancy, high availability, and data security.</p>
