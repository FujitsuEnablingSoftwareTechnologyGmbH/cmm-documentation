                    <p>A green box for a service or virtual machine indicates that it is up and running. There are alarms defined for it, but no alarms have been triggered.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>A red box for a service or virtual machine indicates that there is a severe problem that needs to be checked. One or multiple alarms defined for it have been triggered.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>A yellow box indicates a problem. One or multiple alarms have already been triggered, yet, the severity of these alarms is low.</p>
