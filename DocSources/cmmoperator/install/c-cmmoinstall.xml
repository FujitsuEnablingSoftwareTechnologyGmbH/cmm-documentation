            <p><ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> provides two installation options: <ul>
                    <li>It can be installed in single mode. This means that the Monitoring Service is installed on one host machine. The details on installing <ph
                            conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> in single mode are described in the following sections. </li>
                    <li>To ensure high availability and improve scalability, the Monitoring Service can also be clustered and installed on multiple hosts. For details on clustering <ph
                            conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />, refer to the <i>Cluster Management Guide</i>.</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>The installation of <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> in single and cluster mode consists of several steps. They are partially executed by the Monitoring Service operator, and partially by the OpenStack operator.</p>

            <p>The installation of <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> comprises the following steps: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preparing the installation environment - done by the Monitoring Service operator and the OpenStack operator.</li>
                <li>Configuring the Control Machine - done by the Monitoring Service operator and the OpenStack operator.</li>
                <li>Installing the offline resources - done by the Monitoring Service operator only. </li>
                <li>Installing the OpenStack extensions required for the Monitoring Service - done by the OpenStack operator only. </li>
                <li>Installing the Monitoring Service - done by the Monitoring Service operator only.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a Monitoring Service operator, you also install and configure the agents for monitoring <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. The OpenStack operator installs and configures the agents for monitoring the OpenStack platform. He also prepares the monitoring environment for the application operators who have booked a virtual machine in OpenStack.</p>
            <p>For installing the software components, <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> ships with an installer that is based on Ansible.</p>

            <title>Installation Environment</title>
            <p>The following installation environment is the default installation environment for <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> in single mode:</p>
            
            
          
            
            <fig>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Monitoring Service operator installs the offline resources, the <ph
                            conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            /> components, and the required agents on one host (<ph
                            conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> host).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The OpenStack operator installs the OpenStack extensions and the required agents for the OpenStack Keystone and the OpenStack Horizon service. Depending on the OpenStack environment, Keystone and Horizon are either installed on the same or on two separate hosts.</p>
                    <p>The OpenStack operator can install additional agents for monitoring additional OpenStack services as required.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The installation of the <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> components is managed from a so-called Control Machine. You have to prepare a Control Machine for installing the <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> host. The OpenStack operator prepares a Control Machine for installing the OpenStack extensions on the Keystone and the Horizon host.</p>
