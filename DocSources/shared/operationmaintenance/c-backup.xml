    <title>Backup and Recovery</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>Typical tasks of the Monitoring Service operator are to make regular backups, particularly of the data created during operation.<p>At regular intervals, you should make a backup of all:</p><p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Databases.</li>
                    <li>Configuration files of the individual agents and services.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring and log dashboards you have created and saved.</li>
                </ul>
            </p><p><ph conref="../product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> does not offer integrated backup and recovery mechanisms. Instead, you use the mechanisms and procedures of the individual components. </p></section>
