    <title>Defining Alarms</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p><ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> allows you to define alarms for monitoring your cloud resources. An alarm definition specifies the metrics to be collected and the threshold at which an alarm is to be triggered. If the specified threshold is reached or exceeded for a cloud resource, notifications can also be sent to inform the <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> users involved. </p>
            <p>To handle a large variety of monitoring requirements, you can create either simple alarm definitions that refer to one metrics only, or compound alarm definitions that combine multiple metrics and allow you to track and process more complex events. </p>
            <p>Example for a simple alarm definition that checks whether the system-level load of the CPU exceeds a threshold of 95 percent:</p>
            <codeblock>cpu.system_perc{hostname=host.domain.com} > 95</codeblock>
            <p>Example for a simple alarm definition that checks the average time of the system-level load of the CPU over a period of 360 seconds. The alarm is triggered only if this average is greater than 95 percent: </p>
            <codeblock>avg(cpu.system_perc{hostname=host.domain.com}, 120) > 95 times 3</codeblock>
            <p>Example for a compound alarm definition that evaluates two metrics. The alarm is triggered if either the system-level load of the CPU exceeds a threshold of 95 percent, or if the disk space that is used by the specified service exceeds a threshold of 90 percent:</p>
            <codeblock>avg(cpu.system_perc{hostname=hostname.domain.com}) > 95 OR 
max(disk.space_used_perc{service=monitoring}) > 90</codeblock>
            <p>To create, edit, and delete alarms, use <uicontrol>Monitoring > Alarm Definitions</uicontrol>. </p>
            <p>The elements that define an alarm are described in the following sections. They are grouped into <uicontrol>Details</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Expression</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>Notifications</uicontrol>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Details</title>
            <p>For an alarm definition, you specify the following details:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><uicontrol>Name</uicontrol>. Mandatory identifier of the alarm. The name must be unique within the project for which you define the alarm.<p>Example: <codeph>name</codeph></p></li>
                <li><uicontrol>Description</uicontrol>. Optional. A short description that depicts the purpose of the alarm.<p>Example: <codeph>description</codeph></p></li>
                <li>
                    <p><uicontrol>Severity</uicontrol>. The following severities for an alarm are supported: <uicontrol>Low</uicontrol> (default), <uicontrol>Medium</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>High</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Critical</uicontrol>. </p>
                    <p>The severity affects the status information on the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page. If an alarm that is defined as <uicontrol>Critical</uicontrol> is triggered, the corresponding resource is displayed in a red box. If an alarm that is defined as <uicontrol>Low</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Medium</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>High</uicontrol> is triggered, the corresponding resource is displayed in a yellow box only.</p>
                    <p>The severity level is subjective. Choose a level that is appropriate for prioritizing the alarms in your environment.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Expression</title>
            <p>The alarm expression defines how to evaluate specific metrics. Depending on whether to evaluate one or multiple metrics, the expression consists of one or multiple sub-expressions. Using the logical operators <codeph>AND</codeph> or <codeph>OR</codeph>, you can combine any number of sub-expressions. </p>
            <p>By default, an alarm expressions is evaluated every 60 seconds. As soon as the expression evaluates to true, an alarm is triggered.</p>
            <p>The syntax for the alarm expression is based on a simple expressive grammar. For additional syntax details, refer to the Monasca API documentation on <xref
                    format="html"
                    href="https://github.com/openstack/monasca-api/blob/stable/newton/docs/monasca-api-spec.md#alarm-definition-expressions"
                    scope="external"><u><i>Alarm Definition Expressions</i></u></xref>. </p>
            <p>To define the alarm expression, proceed as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Select the metrics you want to monitor. The select list allows you to access all metrics provided by the agent installed on the host machine to be monitored.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select a statistical function for the metrics: <codeph>min</codeph> to monitor the minimum values, <codeph>max</codeph> to monitor the maximum values, <codeph>sum</codeph> to monitor the sum of the values, <codeph>count</codeph> for the monitored number, or <codeph>avg</codeph> for the arithmetic average.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Enter one or multiple dimensions in the <uicontrol>Add a dimension</uicontrol> field to further qualify the metrics. </p>
                    <p>Dimensions filter the data to be monitored. They narrow down the evaluation to specific entities. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource ID. </p>
                    <p>The dimensions available for the selected metrics are displayed in the <uicontrol>Matching Metrics</uicontrol> section. Type the name of the key you want to associate with the metrics in the <uicontrol>Add a dimension</uicontrol> field. You are offered a select list for adding the required key/value pair. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Enter the threshold value at which an alarm is to be triggered, and combine it with a relational operator <codeph>&lt;</codeph>, <codeph>&gt;</codeph>, <codeph>&lt;=</codeph>, or <codeph>&gt;=</codeph>. <p>The unit of the threshold value is related to the metrics for which you define the threshold, for example, the unit is percentage for <codeph>cpu.system_perc</codeph> or MB for <codeph>disk.total_used_space_mb</codeph>. </p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Switch on the <uicontrol>Deterministic</uicontrol> option if you evaluate a metrics for which data is received only sporadically. The option must be switched on, for example, for all log metrics. This ensures that the alarm state is <codeph>OK</codeph> and displayed as a green box on the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page although metrics data has not yet been collected and sent. </p>
                    <p>Do not switch on the option if you evaluate a metrics for which data is received regularly. This ensures that you instantly notice, for example, that a host machine is offline for any reason and that there is no metrics data for the agent to collect. On the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page, the alarm state therefore changes from <codeph>OK</codeph> to <codeph>UNDETERMINED</codeph> and is displayed as a gray box.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><uicontrol>Match by</uicontrol>. Enter dimensions that should be taken into account for triggering alarms. If you want them to be ignored in the expression that is to be evaluated, leave the field empty. The dimensions you specify cannot be changed once the alarm definition is saved.</p>
                    <p>Example: If you enter <codeph>hostname</codeph> as dimension, individual alarms will be created for each host name on which metrics data is received. The expression you have defined is not evaluated as a whole but individually for each host machine in the monitored environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Build a compound alarm definition, if required.</p>
                    <p>Choose either <codeph>AND</codeph> or <codeph>OR</codeph> as <uicontrol>Operator</uicontrol> to connect a sub-expression to the one you have already defined. Proceed with the second sub-expression as described in Step 1 to Step 6 above. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If required, reorganize your expression. The following options are provided:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an additional sub-expression using the <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> button.</li>
                        <li>Finish editing a sub-expression using the <uicontrol>Submit</uicontrol> button.</li>
                        <li>Delete a sub-expression using the <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol> button.</li>
                        <li>Change the position of a sub-expression using the <uicontrol>Up</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Down</uicontrol> button.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <note othertype="note"
                    >In addition to using the options of the graphical user interface, you can also edit the expression syntax directly. For this purpose, save your alarm definition and update it afterwards. The <uicontrol>Edit Alarm Definition</uicontrol> option allows you to directly edit the syntax. </note>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Notifications</title>
            <p>You can optionally enable notifications to be used for your alarm definition. As soon as an alarm is triggered, the notifications will be sent.</p>
            <p>The <uicontrol>Notifications</uicontrol> tab allows you to select the notifications you want to sent from the notifications that have been predefined for your environment. For a selected notification, you can decide for which state change you want to send it: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For a state change to <codeph>Alarm</codeph> when an alarm is triggered. The box for the service, server, or log path turns red on the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page.</li>
                <li>For a state change to <codeph>OK</codeph> when metrics data has been received for the metrics and there is no need to trigger an alarm. The box for the service, server, or log path turns green on the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page.</li>
                <li>For a state change to <codeph>Undetermined</codeph> when no metrics data has been received for the metrics. The box for the service, server, or log path turns grey on the <uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol> page.</li>
            </ul>
