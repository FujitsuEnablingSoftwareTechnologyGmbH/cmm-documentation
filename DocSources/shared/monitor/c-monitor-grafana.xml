            <title>Building Dashboards</title>
            <p>Each metrics dashboard is composed of one or more panels that are arranged in one or more rows. A row serves as a logical divider within a dashboard. It organizes your panels in groups. The panel is the basic building block for visualizing your metrics data.</p>
            <p>For building dashboards, you have two options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start from scratch and create a new dashboard.</li>
                <li>Take the dashboard that is shipped with <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> as a starting point and customize it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections provide introductory information on dashboards, rows, and panels, and make you familiar with the first steps involved in building a dashboard. For details on working with metrics dashboards, you can also refer to the <xref
                    format="html" href="http://docs.grafana.org/v1.9/" scope="external"

            <title>Creating a Dashboard</title>
            <p>To create a new dashboard, you use the <uicontrol>Open dashboard</uicontrol> option in the top left corner of your dashboard window. The option provides access to various features for administrating dashboards. Use <uicontrol>New</uicontrol> to create an empty dashboard that may serve as starting point for adding rows and panels.</p>
            <fig>
                <image
                    alt="grafana-cmm.png" height="260"

            width="435"/>
            </fig>
            <p>On the left side of an empty dashboard, there is a green rectangle displayed. Hover over this rectangle to access a <uicontrol>Row</uicontrol> menu. To insert your first panel, you can use <uicontrol>Add panel</uicontrol> &gt; <uicontrol>Graph</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Add panel</uicontrol> &gt; <uicontrol>Singlestat</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Add panel</uicontrol> &gt; <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol>.</p>
            <p>As soon as you have inserted an empty panel, you can add additional rows. For this purpose, use the <uicontrol>Add row</uicontrol> option on the right side of the dashboard </p>

        <section
            id="Editing_Rows_concept_conbody_section_6">
            <title>Editing Rows</title>
            <p>Features for editing rows can be accessed via the green rectangle that is displayed to the right of each row. </p>
            <p>In addition to adding panels to a row, you can collapse or remove a row, move the position of the row within your dashboard, or set the row height. Row settings allows you, for example, to insert a row title or to hide the <uicontrol>Row</uicontrol> menu so that the row can no longer be edited.</p>

                    id="Editing_Panels_concept_conbody_section_7">
            <title>Editing Panels</title>
            <p>Grafana distinguishes between three types of panel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Graph</uicontrol> are used for visualizing metrics data. A query editor is provided to define the data to be visualized. The editor allows you to combine multiple queries. This means that any number of metrics and data series can be visualized in one panel.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Singlestat</uicontrol> are also used for visualizing metrics data, yet they reduce a single query into a single number. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> are used to insert static text. The text may, for example, provide information for the dashboard users. Text panels are not connected to any metrics data. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As soon as you have added a panel to your dashboard, you can access the options for editing the panel. For this purpose, click on the panel title. To access an editor for defining the panel content, use <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>. This directly leads you to a query or text editor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>For panels of type <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol>, you can simply enter text, as required. Plain text, HTML format and markdown format are supported.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For panels of type <uicontrol>Graph</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Singlestat</uicontrol>, use the query editor for entering your queries. You can add metrics, and apply functions to the added metrics. The query results will be visualized in your panel in real time. </p>
                    <p>By default, the time range for panel is controlled by the dashboard time picker in the upper right corner of the dashboard. You can define a panel-specific time range, if required.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each panel, a large number of display and formatting features are provided to customize how the content is presented on your dashboard. Click on the panel title to access these features. </p>
            <p>To change the size of a panel, click the <uicontrol>+</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>-</uicontrol> icons in the title bar menu. Additional options in the title bar menu allows you to duplicate panels or to remove panels. </p>
            <p>You can move panels on your dashboard by simply dragging and dropping them within and between rows.</p>

            <p><ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> allows you to save your metrics dashboards locally. Saving a dashboard means exporting it to a JSON file.

            <p>To save a dashboard, use the <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> option in the top left corner of your dashboard window. The option allows you to directly view the JSON syntax and to export it to a file. To import a JSON file, you use the <uicontrol>Open dashboard</uicontrol> option in the top left corner of your dashboard window.</p>
