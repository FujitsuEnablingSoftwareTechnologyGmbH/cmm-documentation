    <title>Log Management</title>

        <section>
            <p>Services and servers in a cloud infrastructure generate huge amounts of log data, from simply announcing that everything is healthy to detailed information on events or processes. The logs are distributed over many physical and virtual servers. <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> collects, stores, and queries these logs and makes them accessible to <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> users in one central place. </p>
            <p><ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> covers all aspects of an enterprise-class log management solution:</p>

                <li

                <li>Buffered exchange of log data to provide high data throughput.</li>
                <li>Logical isolation of log data through multi-tenancy.</li>
                <li>Scalable architecture capable of mastering the data load from a large number of nodes in OpenStack environments. The log management solution can be horizontally and vertically adapted to constantly changing data loads. </li>

            <title>Basic Usage Scenario</title>
            <p>The basic usage scenario of setting up and using the log management features of <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> looks as follows:</p>
            <fig>
                <image
                    align="left" alt="logmanagement.png" height="298"
                    href="../../images/overview-logmgmt-br.png"
                    placement="break"
                        width="700"/>
            </fig>
            <p>The <b>Monitoring Service operator</b> is responsible for providing the log management features to the OpenStack operator. He uses the features himself for retrieving log data on <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>.</p>
            <p>The <b>OpenStack operator</b> uses the log management features for retrieving log data on the OpenStack services and the middleware components that make up the underlying OpenStack platform.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Data Collection</title>
            <p>A Log Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual server where log data is to be retrieved. The agent is responsible for collecting the log data from the cloud resources and sending it to the Monitoring Service for further processing. </p>
            <p><ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> stores the log data in a central database. The central database forms the basis for visualizing the log data for the <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> users.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Data Visualization and Analysis</title>
            <p><ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> supports advanced data visualization and analysis of the log data in a variety of charts, tables, or maps. Visualizations can easily be combined in dynamic dashboards that display changes to search queries in real time, for example:</p>
            <fig>
                <image alt="kibana.png" height="260" href="../../images/kibana-dashboard.png" width="435"/>
            </fig>
            <p>Based on OpenStack Horizon, the customizable dashboards are seamlessly integrated into the cloud infrastructure. They enable user access to all log management functionality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Alarms and Notifications</title>
            <p>GUI-based alarm and notification management is also supported for log data. Based on a template mechanism, <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> allows system operators to configure alarms and notifications for monitoring the number of critical log events over time. When the number of critical log entries exceeds a defined threshold, a corresponding notification is sent. </p>
            <p>The template mechanism is not limited to a single cloud resource but can be used to analyze a scalable set of resources. Compound alarms can also be created for analyzing more complex log events. </p>
            <p>The automation of log handling guarantees that system operators identify problems in their infrastructure early and find the root cause of these problems quickly. </p>
