    <title>Installing the Offline Resources</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>To install the offline resources that are required for installing the OpenStack extensions and the Monitoring Service, proceed as follows:</p>
            <ol compact="no">
                <li>
                    <p>Log in to the Control Machine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The relevant configuration setting are specified in the <codeph>group_vars/offline_group</codeph> file. </p>
                    <p>The file contains the default configuration. No changes are required. </p>
                    <note othertype="note">Make changes only if you have to deviate from the default.</note>
                    <p>To view the default configuration, you can open the file with your favorite editor.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <codeblock>sudo vim /opt/FJSVsvcmm/group_vars/offline_group</codeblock>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To install the offline resources, execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>ansible-playbook /opt/FJSVsvcmm/offline.yml</codeblock>
                    <p>The following response is displayed if the installation is successful.</p>
                    <p>Example: </p>
                    <codeblock>PLAY RECAP ********************************************************
offline-resources-host : ok=40  changed=23  unreachable=0  failed=0</codeblock>
                    <note othertype="note"
                        >There are checks performed during installation that may result in failures or warnings. These failures and warnings are reported but they do not block the installation. It is only this final message that is relevant for a successful installation.</note>
                    <p>In case the installation fails, retry it in verbose mode. To collect debug information, you can execute the following command:</p>
                    <codeblock>ansible-playbook -vvvv /opt/FJSVsvcmm/offline.yml</codeblock>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As soon as the offline resources are successfully installed, the OpenStack operator must prepare the OpenStack platform for <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    />. Refer to the <i>OpenStack Operator's Guide</i> for details on the tasks of the OpenStack operator. He has to install the required OpenStack extensions and has to create the users and roles in OpenStack required for installing and working with <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>.</p>
            <p>Before proceeding with the installation of the Monitoring Service, contact your OpenStack operator and make the corresponding arrangements.</p>
