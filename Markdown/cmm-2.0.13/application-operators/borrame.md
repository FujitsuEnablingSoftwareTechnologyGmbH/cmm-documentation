1: Introduction
```
## 1 Introduction......................................................................................

```
As more and more applications are deployed on cloud systems and cloud systems are growing in
complexity, managing the cloud infrastructure is becoming increasingly difficult. Cloud Monitoring
Manager (CMM) helps mastering this challenge by providing a sophisticated Monitoring as a
Service solution that is operated on top of OpenStack-based cloud computing platforms.
CMM addresses the requirements of large-scale public and private clouds where high numbers
of physical and virtual servers need to be monitored and huge amounts of monitoring data need
to be managed. It consolidates metrics, alarms, and notifications, as well as health and status
information from multiple systems, thus reducing the complexity and allowing for a higher-level
analysis of the monitoring data.
CMM covers all aspects of a Monitoring as a Service solution:
```
- Storage of monitoring data in a resilient way.
- Multi-tenancy architecture for submitting and streaming metrics. The architecture ensures the
    secure isolation of metrics data.
- Horizontal and vertical scalability to support constantly evolving cloud infrastructures. When
    physical and virtual servers are scaled up or down to varying loads, the monitoring solution can
    be adapted accordingly.


```
1: Introduction
```
## 1.1 Basic Usage Scenario...........................................................................................

```
The basic usage scenario of setting up and using the monitoring features of CMM looks as
follows:
```
```
As an application operator , you have booked virtual machines in OpenStack to provide services
to end users or to host services that you need for your own development activities. CMM helps
you ensure that the virtual machines on which these services are provided are working as
required.
The OpenStack operator uses CMM to monitor physical and virtual servers, hypervisors, and
services of the underlying platform. In addition, he is responsible for the middleware components,
for example the database services. The OpenStack operator also prepares the monitoring
environment including available metrics for application operators.
The Monitoring Service operator is responsible for providing the cloud monitoring features to the
application operators and the OpenStack operator. This enables the application operators and the
OpenStack operator to focus on the operation and quality of their services without having to carry
out the tedious tasks implied by setting up and administrating their own monitoring software. The
Monitoring Service operator uses the monitoring features himself for monitoring the operation of
CMM.
Depending on the distribution of tasks in your environment, the tasks of the Monitoring Service
operator and the OpenStack Operator are jointly performed by one system operator or separately
by different system operators.
```

```
1: Introduction
```
## 1.2 The Application Operator's Tasks.......................................................................

```
The OpenStack operator is responsible for preparing your monitoring environment. He activates
the metrics that you can use for monitoring the virtual machines you have booked.
```
```
Metrics
Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a name and a set of
dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair that allows for a flexible and concise
description of the data to be monitored, for example region, availability zone, service tier, or
resource ID.
The standard metrics include:
```
- Metrics on CPU usage, for example the percentage of time the CPU is idle when no I/O
    requests are in progress, or the percentage of time the CPU is used at system level or user
    level.
- Metrics on disk space, for example the percentage of disk space that is used on a device, or
    the total amount of disk space aggregated across all the disks on a particular node.
- Metrics on the average system load over different periods, for example 1 minute, 5 minutes, or
    15 minutes.
- Metrics on memory usage, for example the number of megabytes of total memory or free
    memory, or the percentage of free swap memory.
- Metrics on the network, for example the number of network bytes received or sent per second,
    or the number of network errors on incoming or outgoing network traffic per second.

```
Monitoring Functions
CMM provides a graphical user interface that is seamlessly integrated into your cloud
infrastructure. Based on OpenStack Horizon, it visualizes the health and status of your virtual
machines and enables access to all monitoring functionality and the resulting large-scale
monitoring data.
A convenient dashboard visualizes the health and status of your virtual machines. It allows you
to experiment with many ways of analyzing the performance of your resources in real-time. You
cannot only view but also share and explore visualizations of your monitoring data.
For monitoring your virtual machines, CMM provides functions for alarm and notification
management. Template-based alarm definitions allow for monitoring a dynamically changing set
of resources without the need for reconfiguration. This ensures the efficient monitoring of scalable
cloud services.
Alarm definitions allow you to specify expressions that are evaluated based on the metrics data
that is received. Multiple definitions can be combined to form compound alarms. Compound
alarms allow you to track and process even complex events. Notifications can be configured in
order to inform CMM users when an alarm is triggered.
As an application operator, you:
```
- Build, explore, and share visualizations of your monitoring data
- Create, update, and delete alarms.
- Create, update, and delete notifications.
For details on the monitoring functions, refer to _Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines_ on
page 13.


```
1: Introduction
```
## 1.3 Components.........................................................................................................

```
The following illustration provides an overview of the CMM components:
```
```
OpenStack
CMM relies on OpenStack, a technology for building cloud computing platforms for public
and private clouds. OpenStack consists of a series of interrelated projects delivering various
components for a cloud infrastructure solution and allowing for the deployment and management
of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms.
```
```
Monitoring Service
The Monitoring Service is the central CMM component. It is responsible for receiving, persisting,
and processing metrics and log data, as well as providing the data to the users.
The Monitoring Service relies on Monasca, an open-source Monitoring as a Service solution. It
uses Monasca for high-speed metrics querying and integrates the streaming alarm engine and the
notification engine of Monasca.
```
```
Horizon Plugin
CMM comes with a plugin for the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. The plugin extends the main
dashboard in OpenStack with a view for monitoring. This enables CMM users to access the
monitoring functions from a central Web-based graphical user interface.
Monitoring data is displayed on a convenient and easy-to-use dashboard which fully integrates
with Grafana, an open-source application for visualizing large-scale measurement data.
```
## 1.4 User Management................................................................................................

```
CMM is fully integrated with Keystone, the identity service which serves as the common
authentication and authorization system in OpenStack.
The integration with Keystone requires any CMM user to be registered as an OpenStack user. All
authentication and authorization in CMM is done through Keystone. If a user requests monitoring
data, for example, CMM verifies that the user is a valid user in OpenStack and allowed to access
the requested metrics.
CMM users are created and administrated in OpenStack:
```
- Each user assumes a role in OpenStack to perform a specific set of operations. The
    OpenStack role specifies a set of rights and privileges.


```
1: Introduction
```
- Each user is assigned to at least one project in OpenStack. A project is an organizational unit
    that defines a set of resources which can be accessed by the assigned users.
    Application operators in CMM can monitor the set of resources that is defined for the projects
    to which they are assigned.

For details on user management, refer to the _OpenStack documentation_.


```
2: Accessing CMM
```
## 2 Accessing CMM.............................................................................

```
As an application operator, you must fulfill the following prerequisites:
```
- You must have access to the OpenStack platform as a user with the monasca-user role or any
    other role that is authorized to use the CMM monitoring functions. Additional roles are optional.
- You must be assigned to the OpenStack project whose resources you want to monitor.
Log in to OpenStack Horizon with your user name and password provided as login information
by OpenStack. For monitoring your services and virtual machines, you use the CMM monitoring
user interface which is integrated into OpenStack Horizon. The CMM functionality is available
on the **Monitoring** tab. It provides access to the monitoring data of all projects to which you are
assigned. Before you start, select the project you want to work on.

```
Web Browsers
To perform monitoring tasks, you must use one of the Web browsers supported by CMM:
```
- Google Chrome 63.
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.0 (with Compatibility View disabled)
- Mozilla Firefox 57.


```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
## 3 Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines.................................

```
CMM offers various features for monitoring your services and the virtual machines on which they
are provisioned. The available metrics in combination with early warnings about problems and
outages assist you in analyzing and troubleshooting any issue you encounter in your environment.
The monitoring features of CMM include:
```
- A monitoring overview which allows you to access all monitoring information.
- Metrics dashboards for visualizing your monitoring data.
- Alerting features.
In the following sections, you will find information on the monitoring overview and the metrics
dashboards as well as details on how to define and handle alarms and notifications.

## 3.1 Overview...............................................................................................................

```
CMM provides one convenient access point to your monitoring data. Use Monitoring > Overview
to keep track of your services and virtual machines and quickly check their status.
On the Overview page, you can:
```
- View the status of your resources at a glance. As soon as you have defined an alarm for a
    service or virtual machine and metrics data has been received, relevant status information
    is displayed on the **Overview** page. For details on the status information, refer to _Status of_
    _Services and Virtual Machines_ on page 19. For details on defining alarms, refer to _Defining_
    _Alarms_ on page 14.
- Access a metrics dashboard. For details, refer to _Viewing Metrics Data_ on page 13.

## 3.2 Viewing Metrics Data...........................................................................................

```
The user interface for monitoring your services and virtual machines integrates with Grafana, an
open-source application for visualizing large-scale metrics data. CMM ships with a preconfigured
dashboard that visualizes the monitoring data collected from your services and virtual machines.
```

```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
```
To access the dashboard, use the Grafana Home option located along the top of the Overview
page, and select the OpenStack VMs dashboard from the Home menu located at the top part of
the Grafana window.
```
## 3.3 Defining Alarms...................................................................................................

```
You have to define alarms to monitor your resources. An alarm definition specifies the metrics to
be collected and the threshold at which an alarm is to be triggered for a resource. By default, an
alarm definition is evaluated over a succession of one-minute periods. If the specified threshold is
reached or exceeded within one such period, the alarm is triggered and notifications can be sent
to inform users. The alarm definition is re-evaluated in each subsequent time period.
To create, edit, and delete alarms, use Monitoring > Alarm Definitions.
The elements that define an alarm are grouped into Details , Expression , and Notifications.
They are described in the following sections.
```

```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
**Details**

For an alarm definition, you specify the following details:

- **Name**. Mandatory identifier of the alarm. The name must be unique within the project for which
    you define the alarm.
- **Description**. Optional. A short description that outlines the purpose of the alarm.
- **Severity**. The following severities for an alarm are supported: **Low** (default), **Medium** , **High** , or
    **Critical**.
    The severity affects the status information on the **Overview** page. If an alarm that is defined
    as **Critical** is triggered, the corresponding resource is displayed in a red box. If an alarm that
    is defined as **Low** , **Medium** , or **High** is triggered, the corresponding resource is displayed in a
    yellow box.
    The severity level is subjective. Choose a level that is appropriate for prioritizing the alarms in
    your environment.


```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
**Expression**

The expression defines how to evaluate the metrics. The expression syntax is based on a simple
expressive grammar. For details, refer to the _Monasca API documentation_.

To handle a large variety of monitoring requirements, you can create either simple alarm
definitions that refer to one metrics only, or compound alarm definitions that combine multiple
metrics in one expression.

Example for a simple alarm definition that checks whether the system-level load of the CPU
exceeds a threshold of 90 percent:

cpu.system_perc{hostname=monasca} > 90

Example for a simple alarm definition that checks the average time of the system-level load of the
CPU over a period of 480 seconds. The alarm is triggered only if this average is greater than 95
percent:

avg(cpu.system_perc{hostname=monasca}, 120) > 95 times 4

Example for a compound alarm definition that evaluates two metrics. The alarm is triggered if
either the system-level load of the CPU exceeds a threshold of 90 percent, or if the disk space that
is used by the specified service exceeds a threshold of 90 percent:

avg(cpu.system_perc{hostname=monasca}) > 90 OR
max(disk.space_used_perc{service=monitoring}) > 90

To define an alarm expression, proceed as follows:

1. Select the metrics to be evaluated.


```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
2. Select a statistical function for the metrics: min to monitor the minimum values, max to monitor
    the maximum values, sum to monitor the sum of the values, count for the monitored number,
    avg for the arithmetic average, or last for the most recent value.
3. Enter one or multiple dimensions in the **Add a dimension** field to further qualify the metrics.

```
Dimensions filter the data to be monitored. They narrow down the evaluation to specific
entities. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair that allows for a flexible and concise
description of the data to be monitored, for example region, availability zone, service tier, or
resource ID.
The dimensions available for the selected metrics are displayed in the Matching Metrics
section. Type the name of the key you want to associate with the metrics in the Add a
dimension field. You are offered a selection for adding the required key/value pair.
```
4. Enter the threshold value at which an alarm is to be triggered, and combine it with a relational
    operator <, >, <=, or >=.
    The unit of the threshold value is related to the metrics for which you define the threshold, for
    example the unit is percentage for cpu.idle_perc or MB for disk.total_used_space_mb.
5. Switch on the **Deterministic** option if you evaluate a metrics for which data is received only
    sporadically. The option should be switched on, for example, for all log metrics. This ensures
    that the alarm status is OK and displayed as a green box on the **Overview** page although
    metrics data has not yet been received.
    Do not switch on the option if you evaluate a metrics for which data is received regularly. This
    ensures that you instantly notice, for example, that a host machine is offline and that there
    is no metrics data for the agent to collect. On the **Overview** page, the alarm status therefore
    changes from OK to UNDETERMINED and is displayed as a white box.
6. Enter one or multiple dimensions in the **Match by** field if you want these dimensions to be
    taken into account for triggering alarms.
    Example: If you enter hostname as a dimension, individual alarms will be created for each host
    machine on which metrics data is collected. The expression you have defined is not evaluated
    as a whole but individually for each host machine in your environment.
    If **Match by** is set to a dimension, the number of alarms depends on the number of dimension
    values on which metrics data is received. An empty **Match by** field results in exactly one alarm.
    To enter a dimension, you can simply type the name of the dimension in the **Match by** field.
    The dimensions you enter cannot be changed once the alarm definition is saved.
7. Build a compound alarm definition to combine multiple metrics in one expression. Using the
    logical operators AND or OR, any number of expressions can be combined.
    Use the **Add** button to append an expression, and choose either AND or OR as the **Operator**
    to connect it to the one you have already defined. Proceed with the second expression as
    described in Step 1 to Step 6 above.
    The following options are provided for creating and organizing compound alarm definitions:
    - Append an additional expression using the **Add** button.
    - Finish editing an appended expression using the **Submit** button.
    - Delete an appended expression using the **Remove** button.
    - Change the position of an appended expression using the **Up** or **Down** button.


```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
```
Note: You can also edit the expression syntax directly. For this purpose, save your alarm
definition and update it using the Edit Alarm Definition option.
When updating the alarm definition, you can also change the default time period for each
alarm definition evaluation. For syntax details, refer to the Monasca API documentation
on Alarm Definition Expressions.
```
**Notifications**

```
You can enable notifications for an alarm definition. As soon as an alarm is triggered, the enabled
notifications will be sent.
The Notifications tab allows you to select the notifications from the ones that are defined in your
environment. For a selected notification, you specify whether you want to send it for a status
transition to Alarm , OK , and/or Undetermined.
For details on defining notifications, refer to Defining Notifications on page 18. For details on
alarm statuses, refer to Status of Services and Virtual Machines on page 19.
```
## 3.4 Defining Notifications..........................................................................................

```
Notifications define how users are informed when a threshold value defined for an alarm is
reached or exceeded. In an alarm definition, you can assign one or multiple notifications.
For a notification, you specify the following elements:
```
- **Name**. A unique identifier of the notification. The name is offered for selection when defining an
    alarm.
- **Type**. The notification method to be used. Email, Slack, or WebHook can be selected provided
    that the methods were enabled when installing the Monitoring Service.
- **Address**.
    For Email, the email address to be notified when an alarm is triggered.

```
Note: Generic top-level domains such as business domain names are not supported in email
addresses (for example user@xyz.company).
```
```
For Slack, the URL specifying the channel to which the notification is to be sent. Example URL
with variables for the legacy token and the channel:
https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage?token=<token>&channel=#<channel>
For WebHook, the WebHook URL to be loaded when an alarm is triggered.
```
- **Period**. For WebHook only. The integer value indicates how often a notification is to be resent.
To create, edit, and delete notifications, use **Monitoring > Notifications**.


```
3: Monitoring Services and Virtual Machines
```
## 3.5 Status of Services and Virtual Machines..........................................................

```
The following alarm statuses are distinguished when an alarm definition has been evaluated:
```
- Alarm. The alarm expression has evaluated to true. An alarm has been triggered for the cloud
    resource.
- OK. The alarm expression has evaluated to false. There is no need to trigger an alarm.
- Undetermined. No metrics data has been received within the defined time period.
As soon as you have defined an alarm for a resource, status information is displayed for it on the
**Overview** page:
The color of the boxes in the three sections indicates the status:
- A green box for a service or virtual machine indicates that it is up and running. There are
    alarms defined for it, but no alarms have been triggered.
- A red box for a service or virtual machine indicates that there is a severe problem that needs to
    be checked. One or multiple alarms defined for it have been triggered.
- A yellow box indicates a problem. One or multiple alarms have already been triggered,
    however, the severity of these alarms is low.
- A white box indicates that though alarms have indeed been defined, metrics data has not yet
    been received.
The status information on the **Overview** page results from one or multiple alarms that have been
defined for the corresponding resource. If multiple alarms are defined, the severity of the individual
alarms controls the status color.
You can click a resource on the **Overview** page to display details on the related alarms. The
details include the status of each alarm and the expression that is evaluated. For each alarm, you
can drill down into the alarm history. To narrow down the problem, the history presents detailed
information on the status transitions.
